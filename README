JH Lava is open-source software for workload management. It is a new 
branch which is based on openlava2.0. Compared to openlava, JH Lava 
fixes many serious bugs and adds a couple of new features.

More information about openlava: Please visit wwww.openlava.org

===============
Supported OS
===============

JH Lava is supported on Linux x86_64 platform. 
Currently, it is fully tested on:

 * SLES10 SLES11
 * RHEL4.8 RHEL5.8 RHEL6.4

==============
Changes
==============

List of key changes is below. Please contact us for more details.

 * elim management support

   elim management is used to start and manage one or more elims. It 
   used to collect all the elims' information and send back to lim. 
   Configure LIM_MELIM=Y in lsf.conf to enable this feature.


 * User group admin support
 
   User group admin enables configuration of an admin user group and 
   to control the users who can manage jobs (such as modify or 
   kill jobs) for each user group member.

   
 * detailed CPU information support
 
   Enhance lim to collect CPU detail information and display sockets, 
   cores and threads information by lshosts command.


 * short hosts format support 
 
   support bjobs display short execution hosts by default. It will 
   display "4*host1" instead of "host1 host1 host1 host1".

    
 * fix issue: sbatch hang
    
   sbatch will hang forever when it starts a job during creating .lsbatch
   directory process. It causes the job running status forever but 
   actually does not start.

 
 * fix issue: bad job rusage report
 
   Job's rusage reported by bjobs -l command is wrong on some linux 
   platform. The root cause is sbatch reports a bad value.

 
 * fix issue: pim collect process information wrongly
    
   pim failed to monitor process's information and dump bad results in 
   its log file.

    
 * fix issue: b*command failed after reconfig operation
    
   b* command shows below error message when performed after badmin 
   reconfig: 
   Failed in an Batch library call: Failed in sending/receiving a 
   message: Connection reset by peer


 * fix issue: lsrun -p failed
 
   Currently, lsrun -p will run command on each process. This behavior 
   is not correct. Instead, the fix the command run on each host.


 * fix issue: lim core dump
 
   This core dump is caused by incorrect network environment. One case 
   is that the master node knows each server node but one of server 
   node does not know the master node. This which will cause lim 
   on these 2 node go into a dead communication loop and core dump 
   sometime.


 * fix issue: lim core dump
    
   lim will core dump sometimes when it becomes the new master lim if 
   old master node was unavailable for a while.

    
 * fix issue: bsub command core dump
    
   bsub may core dump sometimes during submitting one job. It is caused 
   by some variables not been initialized inside bsub command.

    
 * fix issue: lsrun missing output on some execution node
    
   lsrun -P will miss showing command's output on some nodes sometimes 
   when it is run on a large cluster.

    
 * fix issue: bjobs displays wrong pending reason
    
   bjobs -lp will display redundant pending reasons sometimes.


 * fix issue: bsub -f causes wrong file permission
    
   The file's permission is incorrect if it is copied from a 
   remote node by the bsub -f command.


 * fix issue: exclusive job makes host closed forever
    
   host status become closed and can not anymore accept jobs
   if one exclusive job finished on it and lim does reconfig operation.

    
 * fix issue: badmin hstartup failed
    
   badmin hstartup failed to start daemon on a remote node which reports 
   rsh error. 

   
 * fix issue: lsload displays wrong swp value
 
   real time swp size is larger than maxswp reported by lsload sometimes.

   
 * fix issue: new jobId assigned incorrectly
 
   A new jobId will be used even if the job is not submitted successfully.

   
 * fix issue: CPU detailed information collection failed
 
   lim collection of sockets, cores and threads information failed 
   on RHEL5.1 and RHEL4.7 platforms.

   
 * fix issue: bhosts displays wrong MAX value
 
   the default value of MAX displayed by bhosts is not consistent with 
   the value of ncpus displayed by lshosts.

 
 * fix issue: bjobs -lp dumps core 
 
   bjobs -lp will core dump when there are very large jobs and lots of
   hosts in system and some of jobs have -m option. 
   
   
 * fix issue: child mbatchd dumps core
 
   child mbatchd dump cores during handling bhosts request sometimes.

   
 * fix issue: dynamic resources value updated very slowly
 
   enhanced melim reporting resource mechanism to let it update 
   resource value faster.

      
 * fix issue: lsload help information error
 
   fix help information error display by lsload -h command

 * fix issue: invalid error message displayed
 
   there are some error message displayed for mbatchd during longevity 
   testing.

       
 * fix issue: melim failed due to wrong elim
 
   Once one elim has an error during starting, it will cause melim fail 
   to work and report error message.


 * fix issue: bpost failed
 
   bpost causes mbatchd core dump if the job is already done.
